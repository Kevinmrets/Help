# Filtering and Downloading Tables

How to filter and manipulate data across the data display and report interface

If you prefer a different layout of columns, then click on the header and drag it to a new location.Â

## The Table: Filtering

You probably noticed the buttons labeled 'Filter...' near the top of the columns. This feature is for limiting what is shown in the column. Example: If I only wanted to see my solar RECs, I would click on the filter under 'Fuel Type' and select 'Solar'.

You will be given the option to download either a .csv or .pdf format. CSV files can be edited within Excel, while PDF files cannot be easily edited.

Note: It will download everything that is currently displayed. This means any unchecked columns will not be included in the download.
