# Reserve Certificates Overview 

M-RETS has added new functionality, which allows users to "Reserve" certificates. Reserve accounts and the subsequent functionality are intended for users that wish to manage their certificates outside of M-RETS (ex: selling the certificates through a market feature such as Power Ledger). 

Any users with manage permissions can transfer certificates to a reserve account, this transaction removes certificates from circulation. Once certificates are placed into a reserve account they can no longer be transacted upon and are considered permanent in the account.
